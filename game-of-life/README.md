# Game of Life

Conway's Game of Life.

Nothing fancy, just some simple app to do the game.

You can simulate it, you can also "tick" iteration manually.

You need to set the seed first from the seed page (you won't miss it as it is the first page you see).

### Development

Clone the repo.
Navigate into `game-of-life` directory.

```
npm install
npm start
```

Go to `localhost:3000` to view the app.

Run tests?
```
npm run test
```

Lint?
```
npm run lint
```

### Wishlist
* Use inline style library, `styletron`, `radium`, or something else
* More tests
* Able to set seed with `textarea`, by specifying the array instead of clicking the dots one by one like what I have currently.
